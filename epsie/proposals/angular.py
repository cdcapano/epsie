class Angular(Normal):
    r"""A propsal distribution for parameters that are cyclic over
    :math:`[0, 2\pi)`.

    To generate a jump proposal from a given point, a truncated normal
    distribution centered on the point and with bounds at :math:`\pm \pi`
    around the point. Cyclic bounds are then applied, resulting in a proposed
    point that is in :math:`[0, 2\pi)`. For example, if a the given point is
    at :math:`1.75\pi` and the jump is :math:`+0.5\pi`, then proposed point
    will be at :math:`0.25\pi`. Since the same proposal distribution is used
    regardless of the location, this is a symmetric proposal.

    This proposal can handle more than one parameter; however, parameters must
    all be independent of each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parameters : (list of) str
        The names of the parameters to create proposals for.
    cov : (array of) float, optional
        The covariance to use for the underlying truncated normal
        distribution, in squared radians. May provide either a single float, a
        1D array with length ``ndim``, or an ``ndim x ndim`` array, where
        ``ndim`` = the number of parameters given. If 2D array is given, the
        off-diagonal terms must be zero. Default is 1 sq. radian for all
        parameters.
    jump_interval : int, optional
        The jump interval of the proposal, the proposal only gets called every
        jump interval-th time. After ``jump_interval_duration`` number of
        proposal steps elapses the proposal will again be called on every
        chain iteration. By default ``jump_interval`` = 1.
    jump_interval_duration : int, optional
        The number of proposals steps during which values of ``jump_interval``
        other than 1 are used. After this elapses the proposal is called on
        each iteration.
