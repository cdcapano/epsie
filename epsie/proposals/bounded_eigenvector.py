class BoundedEigenvector(Eigenvector):
    r"""Uses a  bounded eigenvector jump with a fixed scale.

    This proposal calculates the eigenvectors from the covariance matrix and
    always proposes a jump along a *single* eigenvector from a univariate
    normal distribution. Uses a truncated normal distribution whose scale
    corresponds to the width of the boundaries surface along the specific
    eigenvector.

    This proposal may handle one or more parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parameters : (list of) str
        The names of the parameters to produce proposals for.
    boundaries : dict
        Dictionary mapping parameters to boundaries. Boundaries must be a
        tuple or iterable of length two.
    stability_duration : int
        Number of initial steps done with a initial proposal specified by name
        in ``initial_proposal``. After this eigenvalues and eigenvectors are
        evaluated (and never again) and jumps proposed along those.
    initial_proposal : {'at_adaptive_bounded_normal', 'bounded_normal'}
        Name of the initial proposal that is called before the number of
        proposal steps exceeds ``stability_duration``. Default is
        ``'at_adaptive_bounded_normal'``.
    jump_interval : int, optional
        The jump interval of the proposal, the proposal only gets called every
        jump interval-th time. After ``jump_interval_duration`` number of
        proposal steps elapses the proposal will again be called on every
        chain iteration. By default ``jump_interval`` = 1.
    jump_interval_duration : int, optional
        The number of proposals steps during which values of ``jump_interval``
        other than 1 are used. After this elapses the proposal is called on
        each iteration.
    shuffle_rate : float (optional)
        Probability of shuffling the eigenvector jump probabilities. By
        default 0.33.

    initial_proposal : str, optional
        Name of the initial proposal that is called before the number of
        proposal seps exceeds ``stability_duration``. By default se to the
