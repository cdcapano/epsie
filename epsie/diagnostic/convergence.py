def gelman_rubin_test(sampler, burnin_iter, full=False):
    """
    Calculate the Gelman-Rubin (GR) convergence test outlined in [1] for
    parallel, independent MCMC chains. The final statistic is averaged over all
    parameters unless `full=True`, in which case the GR statistic is returned
    for each parameter.

    For a PT sampler the GR statistic is calculated using the coldest chains.

    Typically values of less than 1.1 or 1.2 are recommended.

    Arguments
    ---------
    sampler : {:py:class:`epsie.sampler.MetropolisHastingsSampler`,
               :py:class:`epsie.sampler.ParallelTemperedSampler`}
        Epsie sampler whose samples to extract.
    burnin_iter : int, optional
        Number of burnin iterations to be thrown away.

    Returns
    -------
    R : float (or array)
        GR statistics.
