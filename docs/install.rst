Installation
------------

The easiest way to install EPSIE is via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install epsie

If you wish to install from the latest source code instead, you can clone a
copy of the repository from GitHub, at https://github.com/cdcapano/epsie.


Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

EPSIE requires Python 3.6 or later. The number of required dependencies for
EPSIE is purposely kept to a minimum, to make for a light weight, quick to
install package. You can find the required packages in the ``requirements.txt``
file. If you are installing from source, these can be installed via pip with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Optional dependencies can be found in ``companion.txt``. These are needed for
running the tutorials and building documentation, but are not necessary for
regular use.
